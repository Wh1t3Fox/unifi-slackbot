# UniFi Slack Bot

A slackbot for providing voucher codes through slack

## Structure
- NodeJS
- ES6
- NodeMon
- SlackBots
- node-unifi
- Color-Console

## Usage
I'm using Docker to run a dev version off the setup.

1. To start using this setup download the latest version of Docker.
2. Create a copy of the sample.config.js and name it config.js
3. Enter your slackbot key and UniFi credentials into the config file.
4. Then run the build_docker.sh file and you are off to the races.
5. Open Kitematic to see the build progress.

Then open up slack and start a chat with the bot.
That's it. Easy right?
